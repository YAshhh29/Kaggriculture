"""Route-following agent distilled from a recorded top-player game.

The route plays a cow/sheep pasture strategy. Its source game was taken
from the public leaderboard via the Kaggle API, not from this project's
own match history, where opponents are matched near our own rating. The
recorded side won the game.

Open-loop playback: a fixed per-step lookup into the recorded action
sequence, indexed `step + 1`.
