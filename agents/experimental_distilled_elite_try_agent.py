"""Route-following agent distilled from a recorded top-player game.

Selected on provenance rather than on a local panel: the source is a ranked
game in which a top-rated team beat another strong team by a wide margin,
taken from the records in `rl/data/top_matches.jsonl`. Over 128 local games
against this project's earlier ladder agents it won 87.5%; that is local
evidence, not a rating forecast.

Open-loop playback: the action recorded at replay index k was chosen while
observing step k-1, so `decide` looks up index `step + 1`.
