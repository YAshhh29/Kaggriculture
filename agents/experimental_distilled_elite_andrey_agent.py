"""Route-following agent distilled from a recorded top-player game.

The route was chosen by scoring 191 candidate recordings (the winning side
of every cached replay from a team rated 2400+) on our own final reward,
then re-checked against real ladder opponents. Own reward was used rather
than win rate because win rate against fixed recordings overstates live
strength.

Open-loop playback: the action recorded at replay index k was chosen while
observing step k-1, so `decide` looks up index `step + 1`.
